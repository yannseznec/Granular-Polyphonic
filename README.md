# Granular Polyphonic Sampling Synthesizer
Pure Data (PD) system for making fun noises from samples

This patch takes polyphonic MIDI note input (currently up to 8 voices, but potentially many more if you like) and uses these to play a granular synth system. 

There are various parameters to play with.

TO DO:
- make this a better Read Me file
- the note-to-pitch system is kinda borked and should be better
- many many other things
